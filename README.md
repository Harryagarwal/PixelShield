# PixelShield - Java Image Encryption and Decryption

PixelShield is a Java project that offers a simple yet effective image encryption and decryption tool. Using XOR operation, the program allows users to secure their image files with a custom key. The graphical user interface (GUI) provides an intuitive way to encrypt and decrypt images.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/PixelShield.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Run the `ImageOperation` class.

4. The GUI will prompt you to open an image file and enter a key for encryption or decryption.

## Important Notes

- PixelShield uses a basic XOR operation, suitable for educational purposes.

- Always back up your original images, as the program directly modifies the selected files.

- For enhanced security, consider using advanced encryption algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## Dependencies

- Java Swing for GUI components.
